A simple interactive hangman game written in Haskell.

This is mostly just a demo to show that Haskell and functional programming are
capable of being used for real-world purposes, such as games.

This program was written on Fedora 14 using ghc 6.12.3, and currently assumes
that a system dictionary will be found in /usr/share/dict/words.
